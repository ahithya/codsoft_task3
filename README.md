# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the famous **Iris dataset** to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three species:

- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Using sepal and petal measurements, a **Random Forest Classifier** was trained to predict the species of the flower with high accuracy.

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ðŸ“Š Workflow

1. Load the dataset
2. Visualize & explore the data
3. Encode the labels
4. Train a machine learning model (Random Forest)
5. Evaluate the model
6. Visualize predictions using a confusion matrix

---

## âœ… Results

- Achieved high accuracy on test data
- Visualized confusion matrix for better understanding

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `flower.py`: Python script with the complete ML pipeline
- `IRIS.csv`: Dataset file

---

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure `IRIS.csv` is in the same folder as `flower.py`
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python flower.py
